# End-to-End-Water-Potability-Check

:sassy_man: This is an End-To-End Machine learning model for predicting whether the water is safe for drinking or not with 100 % of accuracy.

:mage: The features used in this project are Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Conductivity, Organic_carbon,Turbidity, Potability, sulphate, trihalomethanes, ph level

You can access the deployed model prediction here :eyes:

Let's say if we want to do prediction... The way it will show result is--- >
